# **Swift Corelibs Multitasking**

## **ðŸš€ The Ultimate Concurrency and Parallelism Library for Swift**

### **Overview**

Welcome to `swift-corelibs-multitasking` â€“ the state-of-the-art library engineered to transform concurrency and parallelism in Apple's ecosystem. Leveraging the power of Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), this library brings advanced scheduling algorithms, superior thread management, and seamless integration with Swiftâ€™s async/await features to deliver unmatched performance and efficiency in multitasking operations. @apple

## **Key Features**

### **ðŸŒŸ Advanced Scheduling Algorithms**
- **FairScheduler**: Ensures equal execution opportunities for all tasks, preventing any single task from monopolizing resources.
- **PriorityScheduler**: Executes tasks based on assigned priority levels, allowing critical tasks to be processed first.
- **DeadlineScheduler**: Schedules tasks according to their deadlines, ensuring time-sensitive tasks are completed on time.
- **LoadBalancer**: Dynamically distributes tasks across available resources for optimal performance and efficiency.

### **âš¡ Superior Thread Management**
- **Thread Pooling**: Efficiently manages thread creation and reuse to minimize overhead and improve performance.
- **Thread Prioritization**: Assigns priorities to threads to ensure that critical tasks get the resources they need.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks thread performance and resource utilization to adapt to changing workloads.

### **ðŸ”— Seamless Swift Integration**
- **Async/Await Support**: Full integration with Swift's async/await syntax for modern, asynchronous programming.
- **Combine Framework Integration**: Leverages the power of Combine to handle complex task coordination and data flow.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Linux, providing a consistent multitasking solution across platforms.

### **ðŸ“Š Comprehensive Performance Monitoring**
- **Real-time Metrics**: Tracks performance metrics in real-time to identify bottlenecks and optimize task execution.
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides extensive logs of task execution and system performance for debugging and analysis.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Configures alerts for specific performance thresholds to proactively address potential issues.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Xcode 12.5 or later
- Swift 5.5 or later

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-multitasking.git
cd swift-corelibs-multitasking
swift build
```

### **Installation**
```bash
import Multitasking

let task = Task(name: "Sample Task") {
    // Perform task
    print("Task is running")
}

let scheduler = TaskScheduler()
scheduler.addTask(task)
scheduler.run()
```
